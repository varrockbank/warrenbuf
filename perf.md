# Performance

This documents profiles performance and documents R&D decisions.

This project has 3 pillars of performance

1. network payload size
2. How responsive the editor is 
3. capacity (how large of files we can load)

At the time of writing, the network payload size is ~3KB 
and the responsive is in <20ms. 

We will see how far we can push the capacity limit.
Eventually, but in the distant edge cases, responsiveness will degrade.
In fact, we may even see issues of correctness.

We want to profile the behavior at that boundary, perhaps study 
solutions, which informs our design decision, but not necessarily dictate it.
In simpler terms, we may discover that it's possible to handle mega large files with some tweaks but the trade-off to the vast majority of usage is not 
worth optimizing for this long tail.

# Basic Load Test with Naive File Loader 

This is load test with a "naive loader" which reads the file into the heap and splits on "\n".

It took ~1 second to load the 100mb 10 million line file with the naive loader. Same as with VSCode.

We stop here for the naive loader because its limit is somewhere between the 10 million and 20 million line files. This is likely due to the string length and/or
the ability split on "\n" for such a large string. 

## File 

To avoid Git hosting excessive large files, resouces directory only contain up 200k file. The files were generated as follows:

```bash
seq 1 5000000 | awk '{print "This is line number " $1}' > 5_million_lines.txt
```

This is not representative of real files because there is alot of regularity.
However, it makes it convenient to do apples to apples comparison. 
I also don't trust that the data isn't corrupted or corrupting the app otherwise
where wrong line numbers are attributed. 

## Chunked File Loading 

### No improvement: Sequentially adding lines 

We add an `#appendLine` method to model and send in 100k lines at a time. 

```
const fileLines = fileSourceTextString.split('\n');
primary.Model.lines = []; // Reset the model to start fresh
const BATCH_SIZE = 100_000;
for (let i = 0; i < fileLines.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
  const batch = fileLines.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
  editor.Model.appendLines(batch);
}
```

This doesn't work and still fails on 20 million line files. The bottleneck seems to be on the source file 
being in memory. 

Suspecting `fileSourceTextString.split('\n')` is the issue, the next attempt involved scanning through
fileSourceTextString manually, splitting the string in half (half being the unprocessed string right of new line break) as we grab a chunk and append it. This stil doesn't work. 

### ~70million : File.slice to read byte chunks 

We avoid converting the file to String right away. 
The unit of iteration however are in terms of bytes, i.e. 1mb at a time, rather than lines and strings and delimiters. 

It works!

The browser tab crashes out at 72 million on a 100 million line file. 

Naive is a little faster between 25-k5 million where performance starts bottoming out.

The chunked file byte reader implementation isn't too complex so it should be preferred for the robustness.  

Note: there is a slight off by 1 bug with the chunk-loader adding an implied new line at the end, but that's okay for now. 

#### Memory Usage 

[Chunked] Loaded 70,000,001 lines in 10449.20ms // 1925.363 MiB (2018888931 bytes)

Consumed 3660MB of heap space, near the 4GB limit of Chrome's browser tab limit. 
Running Chrome from the command line you can specify the flag "--js-flags="--max-old-space-size=8192" but this does not seem to increase the tab limit or heap size, otherwise we might have reached 140 million LOC with this approach alone.

4MB
Maximum call stack exceeded when calling appendLine. 

Takeaway is that we don't want our chunksize to be too large as to risk large number
of lines in that chunk that would call appendLines to fail. At the same time, 
larger chunk sizes are more performant.

* Unhandled bugs

- At last character of last last line. Behaviors such as move next row, move next col should add new line to buffer
- tab character messes up the rendering

* Rendering improvements

- When on the last position of the last line of a selection, render the cursor position with a different color. Vim uses one color for the selection and a special color for the actual cursor.
